## Fall asleep with Sleeply

Having trouble falling asleep? I did, and listening to calming music helped me.
Sleeply as of now, contains 8 sounds:

- Sounds of the forest
- Ocean sounds
- Rain
- Shamanic meditation
- Delta waves
- Lucid dreaming
- Autumn wind
- Enter the void

The user interface is beautiful and it supports playing in the background as well as a sleep timer configurable between 10 minutes and 3 hours.

Don't wait any longer and start falling asleep more peacefully!
If you know any sounds that help you fall asleep, contact me from within the app and i'll add them.
